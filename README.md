#Interesting Hacker Rank challenges
This repository is a collection of interesting Hackerrank challenges that I came across. I am constantly doing challenges so I will be updating these. These solutions are in no way the "Right way to do it" , these are my solutions and if you find a better way to do it go ahead create a pull request, Im happy to learn.

Im only using this repository to keep track of interesting challenges I might visit later.


I have put a brief description of the challenge within the code file with a link to the challenge as well.
